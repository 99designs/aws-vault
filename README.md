# AWS Vault

Securely store and access credentials for AWS. AWS Vault stores IAM credentials in your operating system's secure keystore and then generates temporary credentials from those to expose to your shell and applications. It's designed to be complementary to the aws cli tools, and is aware of your [profiles and configuration in `~/.aws/config`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files).

Currently the supported backends are:

* macOS Keychain
* KWallet
* freedesktop.org Secret Service
* Encrypted file
* Pass - the standard unix password manager

Check out the [announcement blog post](https://99designs.com.au/tech-blog/blog/2015/10/26/aws-vault/) for more details.

   chmod +x ./aws-vault
   sudo mv ./aws-vault /usr/local/bin/
   ```



## Usage

See the [USAGE](./USAGE.md) document for more help and tips.

```bash
# Store AWS credentials for the "home" profile
$ aws-vault add home
Enter Access Key Id: ABDCDEFDASDASF
Enter Secret Key: %

# Execute a command using temporary credentials
$ aws-vault exec home -- aws s3 ls
bucket_1
bucket_2

# open a browser window and login to AWS Console
$ aws-vault login home # the optional -s flag returns the link to STDOUT

# List credentials
$ aws-vault list
Profile                  Credentials              Sessions
=======                  ===========              ========
home                     home                     -
```


## Security
```bash
$ aws-vault exec home -- env | grep AWS
AWS_VAULT=work
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=%%%
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=%%%
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=%%%
AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN=%%%
```

Notice in the above environment how a session token gets written out. This is because `aws-vault` uses Amazon's STS service to generate [temporary credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) via the `GetSessionToken` or `AssumeRole` API calls. These expire in a short period of time, so the risk of leaking credentials is reduced.

The credentials are exposed to the subprocess in one of two ways:

 * Environment variables are written to the sub-process.

 * Local [EC2 Instance Metadata server](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) is started. This approach has the advantage that anything that uses Amazon's SDKs will automatically refresh credentials as needed, so session times can be as short as possible. The downside is that only one can run per host and because it binds to `169.254.169.254:80`, your sudo password is required.

The default is to use environment variables, but you can opt-in to the local instance metadata server with the `--server` flag on the `exec` command.


### Assuming Roles

Best-practice is to have a read-only account that you use on a day-to-day basis, and then use [IAM roles to assume temporary admin privileges](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-roles.html) along with an MFA.

First you'll need to [setup an MFA token in the AWS Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/GenerateMFAConfigAccount.html) and create a role with admin access.

Edit your `~/.aws/config` to add the role_arn and MFA serial number into a new profile:

```
[profile read-only]
region=us-east-1

[profile admin]
source_profile = read-only
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/admin-access
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/jonsmith
```

Then when you use the `admin` profile, `aws-vault` will look in the `read-only` profile's keychain for credentials and then use those credentials to assume the `admin` role. This assumed role is stored as a short duration session in your keychain so you will only have to enter MFA once per session.

**Note:** If you have an MFA device attached to your account, the STS service will generate session tokens that are *invalid* unless you provide an MFA code. To enable MFA for a profile, specify the `mfa_serial` in `~/.aws/config`. You can retrieve the MFA's serial (ARN) in the web console, or you can usually derive it pretty easily using the format `arn:aws:iam::[account-id]:mfa/[your-iam-username]`. If you have an account with an MFA associated, but you don't provide the IAM, you are unable to call IAM services, even if you have the correct permissions to do so. `mfa_serial` will not be inherited from the profile designated in `source_profile` - you must include a reference to `mfa_serial` in every profile you wish to use it with.

## macOS code-signing

The [macOS release builds](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/releases) are code-signed to avoid extra prompts in Keychain. You can verify this with:

    $ codesign -dvv $(which aws-vault) 2>&1 | grep Authority
    Authority=Developer ID Application: 99designs Inc (NRM9HVJ62Z)
    Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
    Authority=Apple Root CA


## Development

Developed with golang, install with `go get github.com/99designs/aws-vault`

### Self-signing your binary

Binaries that call Keychain need to be signed, otherwise they always show the "allow access" prompt. Releases are signed by 99designs certificates, but if you are actively developing and want to mimic the behaviour of a signed release you can generate a self-signed code signing certificate.

Check out Apple's guide on it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090119080759/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/chapter_3_section_2.html), or find it in `Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create Certificate > Code Signing Certificate`.

You can then sign your binary like this:

```bash
make build
codesign -s "Name of my certificate" ./aws-vault
```
